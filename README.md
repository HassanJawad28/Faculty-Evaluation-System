# Faculty Evaluation App (C)

## Overview
The Faculty Evaluation App is a simple C-based console application designed to collect and evaluate student feedback about faculty members.

## Objectives
- Collect feedback from students
- Evaluate faculty performance based on given criteria
- Display evaluation results in a clear format
- Practice structured programming in C

## Technologies Used
- Language: C  
- Compiler: GCC / Dev-C++  
- Platform: Console-based application
